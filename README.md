## Useful `cargo` commands

* `cargo init` creates a new project.
* `cargo build` downloads all dependencies for a project and compiles them, and then compiles the program
* `cargo run` runs the program.
* `cargo update` fetches new versions of the crates in the `cargo.toml`
* `cargo clean` an be used to delete all of the intermediate work files for your project, freeing up a bunch of disk space. They will automatically download and recompile the next time you run/build your project.
* `cargo verify-project` will tell you if your Cargo settings are correct.
* `cargo install` can be used to install programs via Cargo.
